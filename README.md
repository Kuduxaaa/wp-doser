# ‚ò†Ô∏è Wordpress DoSer
Wordpress and Drupal XMLRPC Attack (DoS). XMLRPC is older than WordPress itself. This system was introduced to WordPress to fight the slow internet connection dilemma by helping the users write new posts offline and then uploaded them to the server. The ability to connect WordPress remotely with other applications was only possible with the `xmlrpc.php` file. XMLRPC parsing is vulnerable to a XML based denial of service. **Works on all WordPress sites where xmlrpc.php file manipulation is allowed**
